# Hamming Coding Experiments
Implementation of Hamming encdoing and decoding, with a model of burst errors in transmission. This was the second practical of the
data encoding module. The aim was to test the effectiveness of the error detection and correction capabilities of the Hamming coding
system, with variances on the burst error model and the properties of the encoding.
